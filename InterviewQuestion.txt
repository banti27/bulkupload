Java 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
OOPs Concept:
	Inheritance: extends or implements
		1: Class can inherit from another class via extends
		2: Class can inherit from another interfaces via implements
		3: Interface can inherit from another interfaces via extends
		4: Fields or Methods
	Polymorphism:
		1: Overloading and Overriding of methods
		2: Field can be overriden
		3: Overloading is compile time polymorhism
		4: Overriding is runtime polymorphism
		5: Overloading is done in same class [Arrys ==> sort()//int, byte, short float]
		6: Overriding is done to provide change the implementation of parent class methods for our business use case. [Object => hashcode(), equals()] [Comparator or Comparable methods has to be ovveriden for custom sorting]
	Abstraction:
		1: It can achive via interfaces or abstract classes.[via abstract methods]
		2: From Java 8 interfaces are allowed to have [default and static methods] also so implementation classes has to provide the the exact reference while overriding the method.
		3: Functional interface: [Only one abstract method is allowed]
	Encapsulation:
		1: Encapsulation is a way of hiding the implementation details of a class from outside access and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the class.
		
Execption Handling:
	Throwable(Parent class):
		Error(UnChecked Exception/ Run time Exception): We should not catch it
		Exception(Checked Exception/ Compile time Exception): We must these type of exception. IOException, FileNotFoundException
			RuntimeException(UnChecked Exception/ Run time Exception): 
				NullPointerException, SqlException, IllegalArgumentException
	
	// possible
	try{
	}catch(){
	}
	
	try {
	}finally {
	}
	
	try {
	}cathc(Exception e){
	} finally {
	}
	
	// not possible
	try {
	}
	
	// How to throw a exception from a mehtod?
	thow new YourExcepotionName();
	
	if the exception is a Checked exeption then method also has to thorws it.
	
	void custom() throws CheckExcepition {
	
		throw new CheckExcepition();
		
	}
	
	void custom() {
	
		try {
		
			throw new CheckExcepition();
			
		} catch(CheckExcepition ex) {
			ex.printStackTrace();
		}
		
		
	}
	
	void custom() {
	
		throw new UnCheckExcepition();
		
	}
	
Collection Framework:
	Collection(I):
	    List(I): collection of objects.
	        1: duplicate elements are allowed
	        2: insertion order is preserved
	        ArrayList(C): internal data structure "array"
	            1: read operation O(1) constant time
	            2: write/update operation O(1) constant time
	            3: remove Operation O(n) linear time
	        LinkedList(C): internal data structure "node"
	            1: read operation O(n) linear time
                2: write/update operation
                    2.1: write an element in simple O(1)
                    2.2: writing at given index or update is O(n)
                3: remove Operation O(n) linear time
	    Set(I): Collection of unique objects. Duplicate values are not allowed. With the help of equals() we check the equality of abstract data type.
	        If you want to add any object in set we should, must override hasCode() and equals()
	        If two objects are equal according to the equals() method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result.
	        HashSet(C): internal data structure "hashmap" | insertion order is not preserved | one null value allowed
	        LinkedHashSet(C): internal data structure "linkedHashmap" | insertion order is preserved(doubly linked list) | one null value allowed
	        TreeSet(C): internal data structure "treemap" | Elements are sorted ? Element Must be comparable OR you need to provide comparator in the constructor
	                    | null value NOT allowed.

	Map<K,V>:
	    HasMap: insertion order is not preserved | one null value allowed
	    LinkedHashMap: insertion order is preserved(doubly linked list) | one null value allowed
	    TreeMap: Elements are sorted on keys ? Key Must be comparable OR you need to provide comparator in the constructor
                 	                    | null value NOT allowed.

Comparable(I):
    int compareTo(T o);

Comparator(I):
    int compare(T o1, T o2);
    Used for custom comparison
